            <p>                
                I will always be more interested in building a healthy, sustainable working relationship than almost any other aspect of a job. <br> <br> Interested in my work, or have a project you're eyeing me for, but uncertain about affordability?<br>
                <br>Reach out, and we can figure out a fair compensatory structure together.

                <h3 class="servicetype">Sound Work</h3>
                <p>I’ve built up a significant skillset in audio production (recording, mixing, and rough mastering) over the last decade.<br>
                <br>I relish a challenge, and a certain amount of dirty work - from cleaning up noisy audio, to recording in acoustically challenging spaces, to working with atypical equipment and atypical instruments, I love making weird things work.<br>
                <br>I'm also delighted to work with performers as a recording or mixing engineer - it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure to aid people in the precise pursuit of their creative vision, and I am a patient, passionate, and deliberate collaborator.</p>

                <h3 class="servicetype">Performance</h3>
                <p>Check out my <a href="music.html">music</a> page, and see if you'd be interested in booking any of my bands, or are interested in working with me on performing something else entirely.<br>
                <br>While I mostly perform live as a musician, I'm adaptive and excited to do other kinds of live perfomance, especially ones which are narrative or poetic in nature.<br>
                <br>I'd also be thrilled to work with you as a vocal performer for your audio drama, film voiceover, or sound project.

                <h3 class="servicetype">Music Commissions</h3>
                <p>Need a musical collaborator/sound designer for your podcast, short film, poetry reading, livestream, or audio birthday card? I'd love to help!<br>
                <br>I'm a longtime musical improvisor and would love the opportunity to use my instruments to build sound worlds for your creative work to live in.<br>
                <br>I'm particularly intersted in supporting other artists in making their work come alive - and if you like my work, but don't yet have a project to hang it on, let's talk about it and see if we can make something together.</p>

                <br> It's a pleasure for me to help you get to the heart of what you want to say. If you're not certain about sending your work to me, drop me a line, and let's talk a little about what you're looking for.</p>
